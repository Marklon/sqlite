#Part of OS X & macOS, Apps like Mail & Calendar leverage this single user database. 
# From ~/Library/Accounts/Accounts3.sqlite (10.10+), I want you to get a list of all email accounts (past & present) on that system (this # will require use of .open, .schema and a select SQL statement).


# Inside ~/Library/Accounts/ there are 3 database files
# Accounts3.sqlite	Accounts3.sqlite-shm	Accounts3.sqlite-wal
# open the database with
$ sqlite3 Accounts3.sqlite
> .table
# shows the database table layout
> .schema
# shows the database scehma
# to get a list of the email accounts in the database
> select zusername from zaccount;
# You will be presented with a list of email accounts past and present
